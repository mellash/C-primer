# Contained C code from C Primer Plus book

This repository contains C code snippets from the C Primer Plus book. The codes are organized by chapters, but keep in mind theyâ€™re not sorted in any other way. Some exercises might be missing, and a few codes may not be included! I learned in a bit of a chaotic style, so embrace the journey :)
